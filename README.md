## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/pbbhattpriyanshu/Java-DSA.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Java-DSA
```

Run Java files

You can compile and run any .java file using:

```bash
  javac filename.java
  java filename
```


## 📌 Topics Covered

✔️ Core Java Basics (variables, datatypes, operators, loops, functions, OOP basics)

✔️ DSA with Java (arrays, searching, recursion, patterns)

✔️ Mini Projects (Calculator, Banking System, Games, Converters)

✔️ Practice Sheets (hands-on coding exercises for revision)

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen Java fundamentals

- Improve problem-solving with DSA

- Build mini projects for real-world understanding

- Prepare for interviews & coding challenges

## 📝 Notes


- All practice codes are self-written while learning

- Repo will be updated continuously with new problem
